void funcv(int _n, float _x[], float _f[]) {
    /*
         Description: Populates the x[] and f[] arrays with the functions describing the system of equations to be solved by either the Broyden method or Newton method. To do this f[] becomes the function such as y=x1+2(x2) where x1 and x2 are independent variables in the equation set which would be represented as f[equation number] = x[1]+2x[2]; For the simplifed exponential model the form of the equations is simplifed to reduce computation requirements as such repeated roots are represented by changing the coefficents in front of the part of the equation which represents this root value. See example below for simplification of 4 equations:
             For the sequence {1, 2, 1, 1} one is repeated 3 times therefore the equations can be simplified from 4 to 2. This may not seem like much however as sequence sizes become larger and due to the properites of power-law distributed networks where a great percentage of the roots are repeated the advantages become clearer enabling a 1000 equation system to reduced to less than 50 equations. For the sequence above the simplifed exponential model is used to represent how the reduction of equation is done.
         
             this sequence {1,2,1,1} would be represented by 4 equations where y- is the degree of the node:
         
             1 = exp(x1+x2)+exp(x1+x3)+exp(x1+x4)
             2 = exp(x2+x1)+exp(x2+x3)+exp(x2+x4)
             1 = exp(x3+x1)+exp(x3+x2)+exp(x3+x4)
             1 = exp(x4+x1)+exp(x4+x2)+exp(x4+x3)
         
             however since we know that same degree nodes should have the same lagrange solutions let x1 = x3 = x4 and simplify the equations to the following:
         
             1 = exp(x1+x2)+2exp(2(x1))
             2 = 3exp(x2+x1)
         
         Inputs:
             _n: the number of equations to be solves
             _x: the variables in the equation which are initialized outside of the function by x=vector(1, _n);
             _f: the equations which are initialized similar to _x
             Globals:
             these globals are used because the funcv is not allowed to be changed due to the way the numerical recipes library interacts with it (it is defined inside the library as this form)
             SEQ: the degree of the nodes
             QU: the quantity of each node

void attemptConvergence(int _maxIts) {

         Description: takes an input sequence stored in CONVSEQ whose degree distribution conforms to the equation y = cx^gamma and solves either for the solutions to the non-linear sets of the simplified exponential model whose equations are of the form y=exp(-x1+x2) or the Exponential model whose equations y=1/(1+exp(x1+x2)). To solve these non-linear systems the broyden or the Newton method is used.
         Inputs:
            TO USE THIS FUNCTION:
                First initializeLibrary() passing it a integer which will represent the maximum size of any array used
                Second call setNewSize() passing it the size of the array which you will pass in first. This should be called everytime you send in an array which is different sized than the previous one and always after initializeLibrary() if the size you pass to setNewSize() is larger than that passed to initializedLibrary() it will reset the library allocating enough space to accomodate the new specified size.
                Third set the sequence to be solved for. To set the sequence pass it to setSequence() along with its corresponding quantity array
                Fourth set the guesses for the solutions. To set the guesses for the solution set pass the guesses to setGuesses() this can be set to zero an it should converge to a solution however it will take sometime and may exceed the maximum iterations allowed in the convergence algorithms.
                Fifth set whether you wish to use the FULL or SIMPLIFIED exponetial models using setForSimpExp() and setForFullExp().
                Sixth set for newton or broydn method. Use setForNewton() and setForBroydn() broydn will be faster but may or may not converge as nicely undercertain conditions.
         Outputs:
            XVEC will contain the solutions to obtain these use getSolutions()
            FVEC will contain values which indicate how close the solutions are see getConvValues()
            CONVPROB will contain an indication of whether the convergence has encountered issues see getConditionCode()
