We substantiate this finding by analytical reasoning and by a numerical method, proposed here, based on extreme value arguments, which can be applied to any given degree distribution. Our results reveal a fundamental reason why large scale-free networks without constraints on minimum and maximum degree must be sparse.},

	abstract = {A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections. Here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.},

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against failures and attacks.},

We formally define a community to be a subgraph that is internally highly connected and has no deeper substructure. We use tools of combinatorics to show that any such community must contain a dense Erd{\textbackslash}"os-R{\textbackslash}'enyi (ER) subgraph. Based on mathematical arguments, we hypothesize that any graph with a heavy-tailed degree distribution and community structure must contain a scale free collection of dense ER subgraphs. These theoretical observations corroborate well with empirical evidence. From this, we propose the Block Two-Level Erd{\textbackslash}"os-R{\textbackslash}'enyi (BTER) model, and demonstrate that it accurately captures the observable properties of many real-world social networks.},

	abstract = {The interactions between the components of complex networks are often directed. Proper modeling of such systems frequently requires the construction of ensembles of digraphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. As the number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free, guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or from any other chosen distribution.},

However, the recent research on the online social networks modifies the widespread belief, and many online social networks show a disassortative or neutral mixing feature. Especially, we found that an online social network, Wealink, underwent a transition from degree assortativity characteristic of real social networks to degree disassortativity characteristic of many online social networks, and the transition can be reasonably elucidated by a simple network model that we propose. The relations among network assortativity, clustering, and modularity are also discussed in the paper.},

	abstract = {Uniform sampling from graphical realizations of a given degree sequence is a fundamental component in simulation-based measurements of network observables, with applications ranging from epidemics, through social networks to Internet modeling. Existing graph sampling methods are either link-swap based (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or, alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and from binomial distributions.},

	abstract = {Many real-world networks exhibit correlations between the node degrees. For instance, in social networks nodes tend to connect to nodes of similar degree. Conversely, in biological and technological networks, high-degree nodes tend to be linked with low-degree nodes. Degree correlations also affect the dynamics of processes supported by a network structure, such as the spread of opinions or epidemics. The proper modelling of these systems, i.e., without uncontrolled biases, requires the sampling of networks with a specified set of constraints. We present a solution to the sampling problem when the constraints imposed are the degree correlations. In particular, we develop an efficient and exact method to construct and sample graphs with a specified joint-degree matrix, which is a matrix providing the number of edges between all the sets of nodes of a given degree, for all degrees, thus completely specifying all pairwise degree correlations, and additionally, the degree sequence itself. Our algorithm always produces independent samples without backtracking. The complexity of the graph construction algorithm is O(NM) where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges.},

	abstract = {The analysis of massive graphs is now becoming a very important part of science and industrial research. This has led to the construction of a large variety of graph models, each with their own advantages. The Stochastic Kronecker Graph (SKG) model has been chosen by the Graph500 steering committee to create supercomputer benchmarks for graph algorithms. The major reasons for this are its easy parallelization and ability to mirror real data. Although SKG is easy to implement, there is little understanding of the properties and behavior of this model. We show that the parallel variant of the edge-configuration model given by Chung and Lu (referred to as CL) is notably similar to the SKG model. The graph properties of an SKG are extremely close to those of a CL graph generated with the appropriate parameters. Indeed, the final probability matrix used by SKG is almost identical to that of a CL model. This implies that the graph distribution represented by SKG is almost the same as that given by a CL model. We also show that when it comes to fitting real data, CL performs as well as SKG based on empirical studies of graph properties. CL has the added benefit of a trivially simple fitting procedure and exactly matching the degree distribution. Our results suggest that users of the SKG model should consider the CL model because of its similar properties, simpler structure, and ability to fit a wider range of degree distributions. At the very least, CL is a good control model to compare against.},

Here we show that degeneracy appears when the corresponding density of states function is not log-concave, which is typically the consequence of nonlinear relationships between the constraining observables. Exploiting these nonlinear relationships here we propose a solution to the degeneracy problem for a large class of systems via transformations that render the density of states function log-concave.
