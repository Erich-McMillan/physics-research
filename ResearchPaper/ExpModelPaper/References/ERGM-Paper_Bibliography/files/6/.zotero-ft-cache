Abstract

We study the realizability of scale-free networks with a given degree sequence, showing that the fraction of realizable sequences undergoes two first-order transitions at the values 0 and 2 of the power-law exponent. We substantiate this finding by analytical reasoning and by a numerical method, proposed here, based on extreme value arguments, which can be applied to any given degree distribution. Our results reveal a fundamental reason why large scale-free networks without constraints on minimum and maximum degree must be sparse.

How nodes connect to each other may explain why we don’t see certain classes of networks.

Heating up of Superconductors
January 27, 2017

This collection marks the 30th anniversary of the discovery of high-temperature superconductors. The papers selected highlight some of the advances that have been made to date, both in understanding why these compounds behave in the way they do, and in utilizing them in applications. The papers included in the collection have been made free to read.
APS and CERN Sign Open Access Agreement for SCOAP 3

APS and CERN, the host organization of SCOAP 3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics), have signed an agreement to make the high-energy physics (HEP) articles published in three leading APS journals open access beginning January 1, 2018. This agreement acts to support the publishing of open access content for wider benefit of the HEP community.
