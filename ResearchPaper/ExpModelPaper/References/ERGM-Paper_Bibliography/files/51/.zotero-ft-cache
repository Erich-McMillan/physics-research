Title: Reducing Degeneracy in Maximum Entropy Models of Networks
Authors: Szabolcs Horvát , Éva Czabarka , Zoltán Toroczkai

    Abstract: Based on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, exponential random graphs provide a family of principled models that allow the prediction of network properties as constrained by empirical data (observables). However, their use is often hindered by the degeneracy problem characterized by spontaneous symmetry-breaking, where predictions fail. Here we show that degeneracy appears when the corresponding density of states function is not log-concave, which is typically the consequence of nonlinear relationships between the constraining observables. Exploiting these nonlinear relationships here we propose a solution to the degeneracy problem for a large class of systems via transformations that render the density of states function log-concave. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated on examples.
