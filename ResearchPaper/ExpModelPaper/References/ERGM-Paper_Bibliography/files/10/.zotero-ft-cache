Abstract

A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections. Here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.

Collection
Heating up of Superconductors
January 27, 2017

This collection marks the 30th anniversary of the discovery of high-temperature superconductors. The papers selected highlight some of the advances that have been made to date, both in understanding why these compounds behave in the way they do, and in utilizing them in applications. The papers included in the collection have been made free to read.
APS and CERN Sign Open Access Agreement for SCOAP 3

APS and CERN, the host organization of SCOAP 3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics), have signed an agreement to make the high-energy physics (HEP) articles published in three leading APS journals open access beginning January 1, 2018. This agreement acts to support the publishing of open access content for wider benefit of the HEP community.

    Size of the giant component as a fraction of graph size for graphs with the edge distribution given in Eq. ( 9 ). The points are simulation results for graphs of N = 100   000 vertices, while the solid lines are the numerical solution of Eq. ( 8 ). Each point is an average over ten graphs; the resulting statistical errors are smaller than the symbols. The values of p are 0.5 (circles), p 0 = 0.146 … (squares), and 0.05 (triangles).
