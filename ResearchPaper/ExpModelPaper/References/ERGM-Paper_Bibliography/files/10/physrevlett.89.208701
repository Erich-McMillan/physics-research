Here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":6326048,"mean":5.8270514098297,"rank":336925,"pct":94,"higher_than":5989108},"journal":{"count":14199,"mean":9.8988291308635,"rank":1699,"pct":88,"higher_than":12500},"similar_age_3m":{"count":193513,"mean":8.707503813717,"rank":16334,"pct":91,"higher_than":177179},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":397,"mean":14.732611111111,"rank":80,"pct":79,"higher_than":317}},"authors":["M.
